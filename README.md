# AIGan PyTorch
Unofficial implementation of AIGan from paper "AI-GAN: Attack-Inspired Generation of Adversarial Examples".

Code is based on mathcbc/advGAN_pytorch and ctargon/AdvGAN-tf with my modifications.

## training the target model

```shell
python3 train_target_model.py
```

## training the AIGAN

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## testing adversarial examples

```shell
python3 test_adversarial_examples.py
```
